# Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

# For example,
# Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

# Note:
# Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

# be careful that return type is int not set or list

solution 2:
 def missingNumber(self, nums):
    return reduce(operator.xor, nums + range(len(nums)+1))

solution 3:ï¼ˆfaster than sol 2)
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        return n*(n+1)/2 - sum(nums)
