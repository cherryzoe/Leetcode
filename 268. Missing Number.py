# Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

# For example,
# Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

# Note:
# Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

# be careful that return type is int not set or list

solution 2:
 def missingNumber(self, nums):
    return reduce(operator.xor, nums + range(len(nums)+1))

solution 3:ï¼ˆfaster than sol 2)
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        return n*(n+1)/2 - sum(nums)

solution 4: Bit computation
#Idea: 
# In a complete array with no missing numbers, the index and value should be perfectly corresponding( nums[index] = index), so in a missing array, what left finally is the missing number.
        
        res = 0
        size = len(nums)
        for i in range(size):
            res ^= i ^ nums[i]
        res ^= size
        return res
