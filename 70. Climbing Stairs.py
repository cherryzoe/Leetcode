# You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

# Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

# Example 1:

# Input: 2
# Output:  2
# Explanation:  There are two ways to climb to the top.

# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps
# Example 2:

# Input: 3
# Output:  3
# Explanation:  There are three ways to climb to the top.

# 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 1 step + 2 steps
# 3. 2 steps + 1 step

# Idea:
# Basicly it's Fabonacci array. The final step is just two option: 1 step or 2 step. Those two option are totally isolated with each other. 
# If we take one, it will not affect the other one. so we can say the final result is the sum of those two options.
# tranfer formula: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
# initial state: f(1) = 1   f(2) = 2(two options to reach step 2: 1+1 or 2)
