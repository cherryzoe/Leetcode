# Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

# Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

# Idea: 
# Since we couldn’t enter the preceding node, we can not delete the given node. 
# We can just copy the next node to the given node and delete the next one
